# Car-Models

# Recently, I was looking to purchase car. Thus, I have decided to make some research on cars using engine capacity, performance factor, model, sales, price etc. 
# By doing some research, I found car sales dataset.
# BI is a great tool to do market research and also recognize the current market.
# Consequently, I have decided to use in one project so I am creating a project using car sales dataset here.
# This projects is more inclined towards BI side. Thus, I have used some python, SSRS, SQL and tableau.
# First of all, I have decided to create some tables and manipulate and retrieve data using SQL scripts so I have used python to transfer data from CSV to SQL.
# Actually, I could use SSIS but I just want to try something different this time.
# Afterwards, I have build some SQL scripts and also SSRS reports to see car sales data in a different perspective. 
# I have also created different folders in my repo so anyone could recognize the sections.
# Next, I have scrutinize data using tableau 
# Actually, I have put some tableau links to see graphs in my public tableau profile.
# I hope you would like it.
# This is my initiative by building a really small project to show my skill set.
# (1) python-SQL : I am transferring data from csv format to sql format
# (2) SSRS reports
# (3) tableau graphs:https://public.tableau.com/profile/john2667#!/vizhome/CarSalesandPricesofManufacturer/PriceandPerformancefactor
